Mimicker Alarm, a Microsoft Garage Project
====================================
Mimicker Alarm is a morning alarm clock app for Android that helps you wake up and stay up by playing a simple game, called a "Mimic". To dismiss your alarm, you must mimic the action given, lest your alarm ring again. Each game is powered by [Microsoft Project Oxford](<https://www.projectoxford.ai>), a set of machine learning APIs aimed at helping developers understand and act on the data around them.
